# Examproject

So this our Examproject solving the problems that can be seen either as pdf in "Introduction to programming sommer 2019.pdf" or in jupyterlab in exam_2019.ipynb-file. 
The answer to all the problems are shown in the "examproject.ipynb"-file. A few functions used in this notebook are from the "Functions.py"-file, but these are mainly for plotting, as most the code is in the actual notebook.

Best regards Unity Group
