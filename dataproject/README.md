Welcome to our project! (Warning: Do not base your real-life money investing on this theory)

Project topic: Investing

In this project we want to look at gold- and deathcross, which are market signals found using running means.  We want to analyze, if we can beat the market, by solely making an investing strategy based on these buy- and sell signals. 
We have separated our project in three files. One for representation and two for all the underlying code and functions. To produce our results, one only needs to open the dataProject.ipynb file (located in projects-2019-unity/dataproject) which produces and shows the result, in code made specifically for Jupyter Notebook. This code relies heavily on functions defined in the funtions.py- and the Style_plot.py -file (located in projects-2019-unity/dataproject). In these files we have defined functions that download the data from yahoo and also that plots the data in an interactive way. The functions are very versatile a can take all the stocks and years located in the Yahoo database. All the other files are not directly linked to our project, they are attempts and exercises made during the process but everything important has been rewritten in clear formatting in functions.py and dataProject.ipynb.
Additionally, in making our graph we have relied heavily on the bokeh visualization library, so it will be necessary to 'pip install bokeh' or 'conda install bokeh' before trying to run the files. We have also used a module called mpl-finance so 'pip install mpl-finance' may also be necessary to run first.

Happy reading! 
Best regards Unity group.
