# Modelproject
In our modelproject we have chosen to take the classic solow-model and inject with some simple micro-theory about consumption and savings over time (e.i. a Ramsey-model). We try to examine the properties of this solow model where the savingsrate is changed every year depending on the level of capital in society.
To see our project and our results you only need to see the modelproject.ipynb file, but the file relies on a lot of funtions defined in the model_funcs.py -file. This is the result of our project. The remaing scripts in the "/modelproject/Rod"-folder have been made during the project for testing ideas and timeoptimization. 

Dependencies:
We use bokeh in our project (can be installed by pip install or conda)
