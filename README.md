# Welcome to the Unity group project

This github contains the three projects that the Unity group has made while completing the course: Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis at KU.
The three projects are as follows
* [/dataproject](/dataproject): Where we have analysed a technial stock theory using the yahoo stock database
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): Where we have analysed a solowmodel with a microfounded savingsrate (Ramsey model)
* [/examproject](/examproject): Where we have answered the probelms given in the exam week 
We have also included Feedback.txt file with the list of feedback each groupmember has given feedback to.

**The original readme:**
# Welcome to your NumEconCPH repository

We have provided you with the following repository that contains the required structure for this course. **You should not change any folders in the root directory**.

A short description of the files and folders:

* [README.md](/README.md): gives a short introduction to your project. You should change this file so it gives an introduction to what your repository consists of, and how to run the code to get your output. The present README file is always present on [github](https://www.github.com/numeconcopenhagen/numeconcopenhagen-2018/blob/master/README.md).
* [/binder](/binder/): The folder is used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of your repository. For details see this [guide](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/guides/mybinder/).
* [/dataproject](/dataproject): The structure is as follows: it contains a jupyter notebook where all the results should be presented. Furthermore, there is a python module named the dataproject where you can write and structure all your code.
* [/examproject](/examproject): Same structure as above.
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): Same structure as above.
* [.gitignore](/.gitignore): A textfile specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github, and will not be tracked by git.
